    <u>Adviser Statement:</u><br>
I am writing in support of Anurag Sarkar's fulfillment of the PhD Paper Requirement. Anurag was first author on the paper "Engagement effects of player rating system-based matchmaking for level ordering in human computation games", accepted to the 12th International Conference on the <a href="http://fdg2017.org/" target="_blank">Foundations of Digital Games (FDG)</a>.  The conference, where Anurag recently presented the paper, had an acceptance rate of 40%, and Anurag's paper was additionally recognized with a best paper honorable mention award for being among the top-reviewed papers accepted.  For this work, Anurag was largely responsible for the implementation, execution, and writeup of the project, demonstrating his potential for future research.
