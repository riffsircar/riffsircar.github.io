      <p align="justify"> <i id="disjoint19_abs">Prior research has used player rating systems to balance difficulty in human computation games (HCGs) without having to modify their levels by assigning ratings to levels to indicate level difficulty. Skill chains have also been used to define difficulty progressions for such games. Both these methods typically involve associating a level with a single rating or set of skills as being representative of the difficulty of both the in-game mechanics of the level and the complexity of the task that it models, taken together as a single unit. Though effective, this may not be suitable for HCGs where the game and the task being modeled require different sets of skills and abilities. To this end, we introduce a disjoint skill model that separately tracks game and task skill and difficulty in a 2D platformer HCG. We find that the disjoint model enables players to solve more difficult tasks compared to a baseline model.</i></p>

In this paper, we use Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) for improving upon such techniques. VAEs are artificial neural networks that learn and use latent representations of datasets to generate novel outputs. We train a VAE on level data from Super Mario Bros. and Kid Icarus, enabling it to capture the latent space spanning both games. We then use this space to generate level segments that combine properties of levels from both games. Moreover, by applying evolutionary search in the latent space, we evolve level segments satisfying specific constraints. We argue that these affordances make the VAE-based approach especially suitable for co-creative level design and compare its performance with similar generative models like the GAN and the VAE-GAN.</i></p>

      <p align="justify"> <i id="arrays19_abs">Rating systems (like Elo and Glicko-2) have previously been used for predicting the expected score that a player will achieve on a level. We present an approach that predicts not a single score, but an approximate cumulative distribution function over possible scores. This approach assigns each level an array of multiple ratings for different score thresholds. Our long-term goal is twofold: first, to dynamically change level difficulty for each player by using this CDF to tailor the target score required to complete a level; second, in human computation games (HCGs), to identify players capable of setting new high scores that could correspond to improved solutions to underlying tasks. To move towards this goal, we explore the rating array approach using two datasets: one gathered from the HCG Paradox, and one generated from idealized players and levels. We examine the accuracy of the CDF and the expected scores it predicts, as well as its use in serving levels to players who could set new high scores.</i></p>

      <p align="justify"> <i id="inferring19_abs">Prior work has focused on formalizing difficulty curves by using function composition to give precise definitions to curves and their transformations. However, the proposed framework was demonstrated using a single game, and the curves and transformations were defined with respect to the game's ratings-based dynamic difficulty system. In this work, we infer difficulty curves from gameplay data using a method that is based on the aforementioned difficulty system but that can also be generalized to other games for which information on player-vs-level win/loss outcomes is available. Moreover, since this method uses the same difficulty mechanism as past work, it lets us similarly leverage function composition to compare difficulty curves across games, having either a fixed or dynamic level ordering, using a clearly defined vocabulary. We use four different games to demonstrate our method, which relies on an adjustment to traditional playback of ratings-based match data, which we also present in this work.</i></p>

      <p align="justify"> <i id="transforming19_abs">Player engagement within a game is often influenced by its difficulty curve: the pace at which in-game challenges become harder. Thus, finding an optimal difficulty curve is important. In this paper, we present a flexible and formal approach to transforming game difficulty curves by leveraging function composition. This allows us to describe changes to difficulty curves, such as making them ``smoother'', in a more precise way. In an experiment with 400 players, we used function composition to modify the existing difficulty curve of the puzzle game Paradox to generate new curves. We found that transforming difficulty curves in this way impacted player engagement, including the number of levels completed and the estimated skill needed to complete those levels, as well as perceived competence. Further, we found some transformed curves dominated others with respect to engagement, indicating that different design goals can be traded-off by considering a subset of curves.</i></p>

      <p align="justify"> <i id="blending18_abs">Recent work has shown machine learning approaches to be effective in training models on existing game data for informing procedural generation of novel content. Specifically, ML techniques have successfully used existing game levels to train models for generating new levels and blending existing ones. Such blending of not just levels, but entire games, has also been proposed as a possible means of generating new games. In this paper, we build on these works by training Long Short Term Memory recurrent neural networks on level data for two separate platformer games---Super Mario Bros. and Kid Icarus---and use these models to create new levels that are blends of levels from both games, thus creating a level generator for a novel, third game.</i></p>

      <p align="justify"> <i id="desire18_abs">Many games feature collectible items that are manually placed by a designer. In this work, we developed an algorithm, inspired by \emph{desire paths}, for automatically placing collectible coins in a platformer game. Desire paths are paths naturally formed where people walk, rather than those laid down artificially, and are often the shortest or easiest route between an origin and destination. Our algorithm uses player trajectories to find paths along which to place the coins for each level. We ran an experiment comparing path-based placement to other placement methods. Although we did not find a difference in total time spent playing or likelihood of finishing the game, our results suggest that path-based placement leads to players collecting more coins in less time than with designer or randomly placed coins. Further, we found that players played similarly when coins were either path-based or there were no coins, and similarly when coins were either placed by a designer or randomly.</i></p>

      <p align="justify"> <i id="comparing18_abs">Paid platforms like Mechanical Turk are popular for recruiting players for playtesting and experiments. However, it is unclear if paid players have similar behavior or experiences as volunteers (i.e. players recruited for free through banner ads or game portals). In this work, we studied the impact of recruitment within human computation games, using two experiments. First, we compared voluntary recruitment versus paid recruitment with different compensation levels. We found that the highest paid players completed more levels (i.e. achieved a higher volume of completed tasks) and reported greater engagement than both volunteers and players paid less while volunteers completed levels of higher difficulty (i.e. achieved a higher quality of completed tasks) than paid players. Additionally, we also varied both recruitment strategy and the game's design and found no interaction effects, suggesting that while differences exist between volunteer and paid players, experimental changes do not impact those players differently.</i></p>

      <p align="justify"> <i id="meet18_abs">Previous work has demonstrated the effectiveness of rating system-based matchmaking for level ordering within the particular constraints of human computation games. However, players were not informed about the rating system, nor allowed to choose the difficulty of upcoming levels. Informing players of the ratings used in the system and offering them choice of upcoming level difficulty may enhance feelings of competence and control respectively, thereby further improving player engagement. Thus, we attempted to improve player experience by both exposing players to the underlying rating system, as well as offering them choice of level difficulty. We found that players cognizant of ratings both attempted and completed more levels than those who were not. Though additionally offering choice did not significantly affect behavior, we found that player choice was influenced by the outcome of the preceding level. Moreover, we did not observe any significant impact on self-reported measures of subjective experience.</i></p>

      <p align="justify"> <i id="level17_abs">Human computation games (HCGs) often suffer from low player retention. This may be due to the constraints placed on level and game design from the real-world application of the game. Previous work has suggested using player rating systems (such as Elo, Glicko-2, or TrueSkill) as a basis for matchmaking between HCG levels and players, as a means to improve difficulty balancing and thus player retention. Such rating systems typically start incoming entities with a default rating.  However, when applied to HCGs, incoming entities may have useful information associated with them, such as player behavior during tutorials and properties of the tasks underlying the levels.  In this work, we examined using features derived from player behavior and level properties to predict their eventual Glicko-2 ratings in the HCG \game{Paradox}. We found that using regression produced rating estimates closer to the actual ratings than default or baseline average ratings. The use of rating systems allows a unified approach to predicting both player skill and level difficulty.</i></p>

      <p align="justify"> <i id="predicting17_abs">Human computation games aim to apply human skill toward real-world problems through gameplay.  Such games may suffer from poor retention, potentially due to the constraints that using pre-existing problems place on game design. Previous work has proposed using player rating systems and matchmaking to balance the difficulty of human computation games, and explored the use of rating systems to predict the outcomes of player attempts at levels. However, these predictions were win/loss, which required setting a score threshold to determine if a player won or lost. This may be undesirable in human computation games, where what scores are possible may be unknown. In this work, we examined the use of rating systems for predicting scores, rather than win/loss, of player attempts at levels. We found that, except in cases with a narrow range of scores and little prior information on player performance, Glicko-2 performs favorably to alternative methods.</i></p>

      <p align="justify"> <i id="engagement17_abs">Human computation games lack established ways of balancing the difficulty of tasks or levels served to players, potentially contributing to their low engagement rates. Traditional player rating systems have been suggested as a potential solution: using them to rate both players and tasks could estimate player skill and task difficulty and fuel player-task matchmaking. However, neither the effect of difficulty balancing on engagement in human computation games nor the use of player rating systems for this purpose has been empirically tested. We therefore examined the engagement effects of using the Glicko-2 player rating system to order tasks in the human computation game Paradox. An online experiment (n=294) found that both matchmaking-based and pure difficulty-based ordering of tasks led to significantly more attempted and completed levels than random ordering. Additionally, both matchmaking and random ordering led to significantly more difficult tasks being completed than pure difficulty-based ordering. We conclude that poor balancing contributes to poor engagement in human computation games, and that player rating system-based difficulty rating may be a viable and efficient way of improving both.</i></p>

      <p align="justify"> <i id="iccv15_abs">We present an approach to learn a dense pixel-wise labeling from image-level tags. Each image-level tag imposes constraints on the output labeling of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) classifier. We propose Constrained CNN (CCNN), a method which uses a novel loss function to optimize for any set of linear constraints on the output space (i.e. predicted label distribution) of a CNN. Our loss formulation is easy to optimize and can be incorporated directly into standard stochastic gradient descent optimization. The key idea is to phrase the training objective as a biconvex optimization for linear models, which we then relax to nonlinear deep networks. Extensive experiments demonstrate the generality of our new learning framework. The constrained loss yields state-of-the-art results on weakly supervised semantic image segmentation. We further demonstrate that adding slightly more supervision can greatly improve the performance of the learning algorithm.</i></p>

Previous methods for weak-label learning often learn detector models independently using latent variable optimization, but fail to share deep representation knowledge across classes and usually require strong initialization. Other previous methods transfer deep representations from domains with strong labels to those with only weak labels, but do not optimize over individual latent boxes, and thus may miss specific salient structures for a particular category.  We propose a model that subsumes these previous approaches, and simultaneously trains a representation and detectors for categories with either weak or strong labels present. We provide a novel formulation of a joint multiple instance learning method that includes examples from classification-style data when available, and also performs domain transfer learning to improve the underlying detector representation. Our model outperforms known methods on ImageNet-200 detection with weak labels.</i></p>

      <p align="justify"> <i id="iclr15_abs">Multiple instance learning (MIL) can reduce the need for costly annotation in tasks such as semantic segmentation by weakening the required degree of supervision. We propose a novel MIL formulation of multi-class semantic segmentation learning by a fully convolutional network. In this setting, we seek to learn a semantic segmentation model from just weak image-level labels. The model is trained end-to-end to jointly optimize the representation while disambiguating the pixel-image label assignment. Fully convolutional training accepts inputs of any size, does not need object proposal pre-processing, and offers a pixelwise loss map for selecting latent instances. Our multi-class MIL loss exploits the further supervision given by images with multiple labels. We evaluate this approach through preliminary experiments on the PASCAL VOC segmentation challenge.</i></p>

However, while intervals containing anomalies are detected, it has not been possible to localize the anomalous activities in such models. This is a challenging problem as the abnormal content is usually a small fraction of the entire video data and hence distinctions in terms of likelihood are unlikely. Here we propose a methodology to extend the topic based analysis with rich local descriptors incorporating quantized spatio-temporal gradient descriptors with image location and size information. The visual clips over this vocabulary are then represented in latent topic space using models like pLSA. Further, we introduce an algorithm to quantify the anomalous content in a video clip by projecting the learned topic space information. Using the algorithm, we detect whether the video clip is abnormal and if positive, localize the anomaly in spatio-temporal domain. We also contribute one real world surveillance video dataset for comprehensive evaluation of the proposed algorithm. Experiments are presented on the proposed and two other standard surveillance datasets.</i></p>

In this paper we present a method that aims to solve this problem in real world conditions where the person can be in any pose, profile and orientation and the face itself is not always clearly visible. Moreover, we show that the problem can be solved with as weak supervision only a label whether the person is present or not, which is usually the case as people are tagged in social networks. This is challenging as there can be ambiguity in association of the right person. The problem is solved in this setting using a latent max-margin formulation where the identity of the person is the latent parameter that is classified. This framework builds on other off the shelf computer vision techniques for person detection and face detection and is able to also account for inaccuracies of these components. The idea is to model the complete person in addition to face, that too with weak supervision. We also contribute three real-world datasets that we have created for extensive evaluation of the solution. We show using these datasets that the problem can be effectively solved using the proposed method.</i></p>

      <p align="justify"> <i id="jpm15_abs">We compare Oscar forecasts derived from four data types (fundamentals, polling, prediction markets, and domain experts) across three attributes (accuracy, timeliness and cost effectiveness). Fundamentals-based forecasts are relatively expensive to construct, an attribute the academic literature frequently ignores, and update slowly over time, constraining their accuracy. However, fundamentals provide valuable insights into the relationship between key indicators for nominated movies and their chances of victory. For instance, we find that the performance in other awards shows is highly predictive of the Oscar victory whereas box office results are not. Polling- based forecasts have the potential to be both accurate and timely. Timeliness requires incentives for frequent responses by high-information users. Accuracy is achieved by a proper transformation of raw polls. Prediction market prices are accurate forecasts, but can be further improved by simple transformations of raw prices, yielding the most accurate forecasts in our study. Expert forecasts exhibit some characteristics of fundamental models, but are generally not comparatively accurate or timely. This study is unique in both comparing and aggregating four traditional data sources, and considering critical attributes beyond accuracy. We believe that the results of this study generalize to many other domains.</i></p>

      <p align="justify"> <i id="iclr16_abs">Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have recently emerged as the dominant model in computer vision. If provided with enough training data, they predict almost any visual quantity. In a discrete setting, such as classification, CNNs are not only able to predict a label but often predict a confidence in the form of a probability distribution over the output space. In continuous regression tasks, such a probability estimate is often lacking. We present a regression framework which models the output distribution of neural networks. This output distribution allows us to infer the most likely labeling following a set of physical or modeling constraints. These constraints capture the intricate interplay between different input and output variables, and complement the output of a CNN. However, they may not hold everywhere. Our setup further allows to learn a confidence with which a constraint holds, in the form of a distribution of the constrain satisfaction. We evaluate our approach on the problem of intrinsic image decomposition, and show that constrained structured regression significantly increases the state-of-the-art.</i></p>
