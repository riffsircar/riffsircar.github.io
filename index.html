      <p align="justify"> <i id="sequential20_abs">Existing methods of level generation using latent variable models such as VAEs and GANs do so in segments and produce the final level by stitching these separately generated segments together. In this paper, we augment such methods by training VAEs to learn a sequential model of segment generation such that generated segments logically follow from prior segments. By further combining the VAE with a classifier that determines whether to place the generated segment to the top, bottom, left or right of the previous segment, we obtain a pipeline that enables the generation of arbitrarily long levels that progress in any of these four directions and are composed of segments that logically follow one another. In addition to generating more coherent levels of non-fixed length, this method also enables implicit blending of levels from separate games that do not have similar orientation. We demonstrate our approach using levels from Super Mario Bros., Kid Icarus and Mega Man, showing that our method produces levels that are more coherent than previous latent variable-based approaches and are capable of blending levels across games.</i></p>

      <p align="justify"> <i id="multi20_abs"> Procedural content generation via machine learning (PCGML) has demonstrated its usefulness as a content and game creation approach, and has been shown to be able to support human creativity. An important facet of creativity is combinational creativity or the recombination, adaptation, and reuse of ideas and concepts between and across domains. In this paper, we present a PCGML approach for level generation that is able to recombine, adapt, and reuse structural patterns from several domains to approximate unseen domains. We extend prior work involving example-driven Binary Space Partitioning for recombining and reusing patterns in multiple domains, and incorporate Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) for generating unseen structures. We evaluate our approach by blending across 7 domains and subsets of those domains. We show that our approach is able to blend domains together while retaining structural components. Additionally, by using different groups of training domains our approach is able to generate both 1) levels that reproduce and capture features of a target domain, and 2) levels that have vastly different properties from the input domain. </i></p>

      <p align="justify"> <i id="game19_abs"> Creative AI refers to the application of AI techniques, primarily machine learning, for performing creative tasks such as generating art and music. In this paper, we present exploratory work that demonstrates and argues for leveraging such creative AI techniques for game design. We train variational autoencoders (VAEs) on levels from the games Super Mario Bros. and Kid Icarus and show how the affordances of the learned models can help inform co-creative game and level design, similar to applications of creative AI and machine learning in visual art and music.</i></p>

      <p align="justify"> <i id="disjoint19_abs">Prior research has used player rating systems to balance difficulty in human computation games (HCGs) without having to modify their levels by assigning ratings to levels to indicate level difficulty. Skill chains have also been used to define difficulty progressions for such games. Both these methods typically involve associating a level with a single rating or set of skills as being representative of the difficulty of both the in-game mechanics of the level and the complexity of the task that it models, taken together as a single unit. Though effective, this may not be suitable for HCGs where the game and the task being modeled require different sets of skills and abilities. To this end, we introduce a disjoint skill model that separately tracks game and task skill and difficulty in a 2D platformer HCG. We find that the disjoint model enables players to solve more difficult tasks compared to a baseline model.</i></p>

      <p align="justify"> <i id="controllable19_abs">Previous work explored blending levels from existing games to create levels for a new game that mixes properties of the original games. In this paper, we use Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) for improving upon such techniques. VAEs are artificial neural networks that learn and use latent representations of datasets to generate novel outputs. We train a VAE on level data from Super Mario Bros. and Kid Icarus, enabling it to capture the latent space spanning both games. We then use this space to generate level segments that combine properties of levels from both games. Moreover, by applying evolutionary search in the latent space, we evolve level segments satisfying specific constraints. We argue that these affordances make the VAE-based approach especially suitable for co-creative level design and compare its performance with similar generative models like the GAN and the VAE-GAN.</i></p>

      <p align="justify"> <i id="arrays19_abs">Rating systems (like Elo and Glicko-2) have previously been used for predicting the expected score that a player will achieve on a level. We present an approach that predicts not a single score, but an approximate cumulative distribution function over possible scores. This approach assigns each level an array of multiple ratings for different score thresholds. Our long-term goal is twofold: first, to dynamically change level difficulty for each player by using this CDF to tailor the target score required to complete a level; second, in human computation games (HCGs), to identify players capable of setting new high scores that could correspond to improved solutions to underlying tasks. To move towards this goal, we explore the rating array approach using two datasets: one gathered from the HCG Paradox, and one generated from idealized players and levels. We examine the accuracy of the CDF and the expected scores it predicts, as well as its use in serving levels to players who could set new high scores.</i></p>

      <p align="justify"> <i id="inferring19_abs">Prior work has focused on formalizing difficulty curves by using function composition to give precise definitions to curves and their transformations. However, the proposed framework was demonstrated using a single game, and the curves and transformations were defined with respect to the game's ratings-based dynamic difficulty system. In this work, we infer difficulty curves from gameplay data using a method that is based on the aforementioned difficulty system but that can also be generalized to other games for which information on player-vs-level win/loss outcomes is available. Moreover, since this method uses the same difficulty mechanism as past work, it lets us similarly leverage function composition to compare difficulty curves across games, having either a fixed or dynamic level ordering, using a clearly defined vocabulary. We use four different games to demonstrate our method, which relies on an adjustment to traditional playback of ratings-based match data, which we also present in this work.</i></p>

      <p align="justify"> <i id="transforming19_abs">Player engagement within a game is often influenced by its difficulty curve: the pace at which in-game challenges become harder. Thus, finding an optimal difficulty curve is important. In this paper, we present a flexible and formal approach to transforming game difficulty curves by leveraging function composition. This allows us to describe changes to difficulty curves, such as making them ``smoother'', in a more precise way. In an experiment with 400 players, we used function composition to modify the existing difficulty curve of the puzzle game Paradox to generate new curves. We found that transforming difficulty curves in this way impacted player engagement, including the number of levels completed and the estimated skill needed to complete those levels, as well as perceived competence. Further, we found some transformed curves dominated others with respect to engagement, indicating that different design goals can be traded-off by considering a subset of curves.</i></p>

Specifically, ML techniques have successfully used existing game levels to train models for generating new levels and blending existing ones. Such blending of not just levels, but entire games, has also been proposed as a possible means of generating new games. In this paper, we build on these works by training Long Short Term Memory recurrent neural networks on level data for two separate platformer games---Super Mario Bros. and Kid Icarus---and use these models to create new levels that are blends of levels from both games, thus creating a level generator for a novel, third game.</i></p>

      <p align="justify"> <i id="desire18_abs">Many games feature collectible items that are manually placed by a designer. In this work, we developed an algorithm, inspired by \emph{desire paths}, for automatically placing collectible coins in a platformer game. Desire paths are paths naturally formed where people walk, rather than those laid down artificially, and are often the shortest or easiest route between an origin and destination. Our algorithm uses player trajectories to find paths along which to place the coins for each level. We ran an experiment comparing path-based placement to other placement methods. Although we did not find a difference in total time spent playing or likelihood of finishing the game, our results suggest that path-based placement leads to players collecting more coins in less time than with designer or randomly placed coins. Further, we found that players played similarly when coins were either path-based or there were no coins, and similarly when coins were either placed by a designer or randomly.</i></p>

However, it is unclear if paid players have similar behavior or experiences as volunteers (i.e. players recruited for free through banner ads or game portals). In this work, we studied the impact of recruitment within human computation games, using two experiments. First, we compared voluntary recruitment versus paid recruitment with different compensation levels. We found that the highest paid players completed more levels (i.e. achieved a higher volume of completed tasks) and reported greater engagement than both volunteers and players paid less while volunteers completed levels of higher difficulty (i.e. achieved a higher quality of completed tasks) than paid players. Additionally, we also varied both recruitment strategy and the game's design and found no interaction effects, suggesting that while differences exist between volunteer and paid players, experimental changes do not impact those players differently.</i></p>

However, players were not informed about the rating system, nor allowed to choose the difficulty of upcoming levels. Informing players of the ratings used in the system and offering them choice of upcoming level difficulty may enhance feelings of competence and control respectively, thereby further improving player engagement. Thus, we attempted to improve player experience by both exposing players to the underlying rating system, as well as offering them choice of level difficulty. We found that players cognizant of ratings both attempted and completed more levels than those who were not. Though additionally offering choice did not significantly affect behavior, we found that player choice was influenced by the outcome of the preceding level. Moreover, we did not observe any significant impact on self-reported measures of subjective experience.</i></p>

      <p align="justify"> <i id="level17_abs">Human computation games (HCGs) often suffer from low player retention. This may be due to the constraints placed on level and game design from the real-world application of the game. Previous work has suggested using player rating systems (such as Elo, Glicko-2, or TrueSkill) as a basis for matchmaking between HCG levels and players, as a means to improve difficulty balancing and thus player retention. Such rating systems typically start incoming entities with a default rating.  However, when applied to HCGs, incoming entities may have useful information associated with them, such as player behavior during tutorials and properties of the tasks underlying the levels.  In this work, we examined using features derived from player behavior and level properties to predict their eventual Glicko-2 ratings in the HCG \game{Paradox}. We found that using regression produced rating estimates closer to the actual ratings than default or baseline average ratings. The use of rating systems allows a unified approach to predicting both player skill and level difficulty.</i></p>

      <p align="justify"> <i id="predicting17_abs">Human computation games aim to apply human skill toward real-world problems through gameplay.  Such games may suffer from poor retention, potentially due to the constraints that using pre-existing problems place on game design. Previous work has proposed using player rating systems and matchmaking to balance the difficulty of human computation games, and explored the use of rating systems to predict the outcomes of player attempts at levels. However, these predictions were win/loss, which required setting a score threshold to determine if a player won or lost. This may be undesirable in human computation games, where what scores are possible may be unknown. In this work, we examined the use of rating systems for predicting scores, rather than win/loss, of player attempts at levels. We found that, except in cases with a narrow range of scores and little prior information on player performance, Glicko-2 performs favorably to alternative methods.</i></p>

      <p align="justify"> <i id="engagement17_abs">Human computation games lack established ways of balancing the difficulty of tasks or levels served to players, potentially contributing to their low engagement rates. Traditional player rating systems have been suggested as a potential solution: using them to rate both players and tasks could estimate player skill and task difficulty and fuel player-task matchmaking. However, neither the effect of difficulty balancing on engagement in human computation games nor the use of player rating systems for this purpose has been empirically tested. We therefore examined the engagement effects of using the Glicko-2 player rating system to order tasks in the human computation game Paradox. An online experiment (n=294) found that both matchmaking-based and pure difficulty-based ordering of tasks led to significantly more attempted and completed levels than random ordering. Additionally, both matchmaking and random ordering led to significantly more difficult tasks being completed than pure difficulty-based ordering. We conclude that poor balancing contributes to poor engagement in human computation games, and that player rating system-based difficulty rating may be a viable and efficient way of improving both.</i></p>
