Advisor Statement:<br>
I am writing in support of Anurag Sarkar's fulfillment of the PhD Paper Requirement. Anurag was first author on the paper "Engagement effects of player rating system-based matchmaking for level ordering in human computation games", accepted to the 12th International Conference on the Foundations of Digital Games.  The conference, where Anurag recently presented the paper, had an acceptance rate of 40%, and Anurag's paper was additionally recognized with a best paper honorable mention award for being among the top-reviewed papers accepted.  For this work, Anurag was largely responsible for the implementation, execution, and writeup of the project, demonstrating the potential for research.
